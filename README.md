Introduction:
In this blog I will be analyzing the IPL matches 2008-2020 dataset which is obtained from Kaggle. This dataset contains information about IPL (Indian premier league). It is a franchise-based cricket tournament which is played in T20 format (20 overs for each team). We will look at different analysis such as Player Analysis, Venue Analysis, most appeared umpires, Toss analysis, Date analysis, Margin of victory and Specific Team analysis at different venues.

Conclusion:
To conclude, we have found that the players with the most player of match are “AB de Villiers” and “CH Gayle”. The most used Venue is “Eden Gardens”. Toss decision by teams - Kolkata Knight Riders prefer to field most of the times if they win the toss and Chennai Super Kings prefer to bat most of the times if they win the toss. The most number of matches were played in the year 2012 and 2013 and there was a sudden drop in the number of matches played in the year 2014. Most of the matches are played in the months of April and May. Distribution of matches peaked on Saturday and Sunday. Match won by wickets is more than more than match won by runs. Royal Challengers Bangalore have played most of their matches at M Chinnaswamy Stadium as this is their home ground. In terms of performance, they have performed very well at Feroz shah Kotla where they have more wins than losses. Their performance at Rajiv Gandhi International Stadium, Uppal, and MA Chidambaram stadium, Chepauk where they have more losses than wins.
